     CLEMDCMP will format a raw compressed or decompressed Clementine image   
into one of four possible formats:                                            
                                                                              
       1) decompressed pds image file, with pds labels, the histogram         
           object, and an image object, either the browse image or            
           the full image                                                     
       2) decompressed raw image file, no labels                              
       3) decompressed tiff image                                             
       4) decompressed gif image                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Installing and Using Software on an IBM PC Running MS-DOS                     
                                                                              
    The file CLEMDCMP.EXE can be run as is directly from the CD-ROM.          
The CLEMDCMP.EXE software was created using Version 4.0 of the Borland C/C++  
development software.  It was compiled and linked using the large memory      
model.  This program has been tested on an IBM PC 486 using DOS 6.1.  The     
source is in the PC/SOURCE subdirectory.  A make file called CLEMDCMP.MAK     
has also been provided in the same directory.                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
CLEMDCMP has four command-line arguments, which are entered on the same       
line as the command to run the program.  The command to run CLEMDCMP          
will have the following format:                                               
        clemdcmp -arg1 -arg2 input_file output_file                           
                                                                              
The first argument(-arg1) indicates the output format of the decompressed     
image.  The following are the options:                                        
         -p = decompressed pds image file                                     
         -n = decompressed unlabeled file                                     
         -t = decompressed tiff file                                          
         -g = decompressed gif file                                           
                                                                              
The second argument(-arg2) indicates which image object to output:            
         -i = full resolution image                                           
         -b = browse image(smaller file size with reduced resolution)         
The third argument(input_file) is the filename of the input compressed        
         clementine data file.                                                
The fourth argument(output_file) is the filename of the output decompressed   
         clementine image.  Note:  Although CLEMDCMP may be run directly      
         from the CD-ROM, you must indicate a different device for the        
         output file.                                                         
                                                                              
For example, if you want to decompress a raw Clementine HIRES image, and      
create a new file in PDS format(which may be displayed with CLIMDISP) use     
the following command:                                                        
                                                                              
          clemdcmp -p -i LHB4000Y.074 hires.pds
