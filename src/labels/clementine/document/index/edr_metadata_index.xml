        This file concatenates metadata indices from the 88 archive volumes of
        the PDS3 version of this data set. We have not rigorously validated some
        of these fields, and some of them do not map transparently to fields in
        the PDS4 labels of these products due to differences in standards.
        Please use with caution.
