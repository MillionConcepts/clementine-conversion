DOCUMENT : ERRATA.TXT - This is the final errata information for the entire   
                        Clementine EDR CD-ROM volume set (CL_0001 through     
                        CL_0088). This final 'errata.txt' file exists only on 
                        this final volume (CL_0088) and not on the first      
                        volume as referenced in earlier 'errata.txt' files.   
                                                                              
This document is intended to provide an account of discovered errors or       
anomalies associated with the Clementine CD-ROM volume set. Also, many of     
the comments below are a clarification of potentially confusing issues that   
are not necessarily errors or anomalies.                                      
                                                                              
The following section contains comments of a general nature and is            
followed by detailed comments related to specific volumes and orbits.

SUPPLIED SOFTWARE                                                             
  This CD volume (CL_0088) contains the most up-to-date software for the      
  entire volume set. Earlier volumes may contain software errors (as          
  documented in each volume's "errata.txt" file). Please use software from    
  this final volume to ensure you are using the most up to data programs.     
  This up-to-date software exists only on this final volume and not on the    
  first volume as referenced in earlier volume's 'errata.txt' file. Further   
  software updates may exist after the release of the Clementine data product.
  Please contact the PDS Imaging Node for the most up-to-date software (Eric  
  Eliason, eeliason@sirius.wr.usgs.gov, (520) 556-7113).                      
                                                                              
Compressed EDR Image Files                                                    
  A problem was discovered with the MINIMUM keyword value found in the        
  labels of the image files. The MINIMUM value contains the minimum density   
  number (DN) value of the image array. The value is not always correct.      
  If the minimum value of the image array is located in the upper-left corner 
  pixel of the array (row 1, column 1) then the minimum value is not properly 
  reported. The MINIMUM value reported will be the next larger minimum value  
  in the image array. The problem exists for all volumes in the archive.      
                                                                              
Compressed EDR Image Files                                                    
  Inconsistencies may exist between the histogram statistics found in the     
  image histogram object and the actual image that is decompressed on your    
  computer platform. Subtle differences in the floating point hardware among  
  computer platforms may cause the Density Number (DN) values of a resulting  
  decompressed image to be occasionally different (within 1 DN) than the      
  decompressed image used to generate the image histogram object. This        
  problem exists for all volumes in the archive.                              
                                                                              
VOLDESC.CAT                                                                   
  The VOLDESC.CAT file on some CD-ROM volumes may have records (lines) which  
  are not 80 characters in length. This problem exists because the file was   
  updated by hand to reflect the current volume number and orbits included on 
  the volume. Because of the hand input some lines may not be 80 characters   
  in length.                                                                  
                                                                              
RETICLE_POINT KEYWORDS DEFINITIONS                                            
     The definitions in the "EDRSIS" documents have problems for the          
     following keywords found in the labels of the Clementine images:         
     RETICLE_POINT_RA, RETICLE_POINT_DECLINATION, RETICLE_POINT_LATITUDE,     
     RETICLE_POINT_LONGITUDE. The part of the definition that describes       
     the order in which the vector values are listed is incorrect. The        
     ordering should be: "For the Clementine cameras the principal points are 
     defined as the upper-left pixel of the camera (line 1, sample 1), the    
     upper-right pixel (line 1, last sample), lower-right (last line, last    
     sample), and the lower-left (last line, sample 1)".                      
                                                                              
FILE NAMING CONVENTION FOR STAR TRACKER A AND B CAMERAS                       
     For EDRs associated with Star Tracker A and B cameras there is an        
     inconsistency with the actual EDR filename and the file naming convention
     as described in the EDRSIS and ARCSIS files found in the 'document'      
     directory. For example, EDR laa0055u.137 is a Star Tracker A image       
     and the third letter ('a') in the filename implies FILTER_NAME='A'.      
     However, the header label for this image correctly has the entry         
     FILTER_NAME='N/A'. This is the situation for all Star Tracker A and B    
     images.                                                                  
                                                                              
FILE NAMING CONVENTION FOR IMAGES INDICATING FILTER_NAME='UNK'                
     For EDRs where FILTER_NAME='UNK', the underscore (_) character is used   
     as the third character (FILTER_NAME indicator) of the EDR filename. For  
     example, EDR 'lh_5868y.188' has a FILTER_NAME='UNK' in the header label. 
     For those EDRs with this situation, the 'UNK" value is used because the  
     filter status is truly unknown due to missing or unavailable data.       
                                                                              
IMAGES WITH LARGE SMEAR_MAGNITUDE                                             
     Images acquired at the beginning and end of each orbit may have a large  
     SMEAR_MAGNITUDE (greater than 2.0 seconds) due to the slew maneuvering   
     required to observe Vega, the Moon, and Earth.

      The image array are all value 255 for approximately 424 images between  
      sequence numbers 0091 and 6777. This does not necessarily include all   
      images within this sequence range and appears to involve images         
      associated with the Ultraviolet/Visible camera in combination with      
      the F filter or the Long Wavelength Infrared camera in combination      
      with the A filter. However, this may occur for other images as well.

    Comments to this point have been related to the systematic lunar          
    mapping phase. The following are specific and/or general comments         
    concerning pre-mapping lunar orbits, Low Earth Orbits, and Earth          
    Phasing loops A and B.

CL_0081 THROUGH CL_0085 (PRE-MAPPING ORBITS 1-3,5,7,8,10,12,13-15,17-30)      
      The data for these first lunar orbits may appear to contain a variety   
      of anomalies or errors. Many of these data anomalies may actually       
      reflect results of intentional tests. Some examples of these as well    
      as other information are:                                               
                                                                              
        CL_0081 - ORBITS 003 AND 004                                          
           The directory tree labeled for orbit 3 (lun003/...) actually       
           contains all image data for orbit 4. These orbit 4 images are also 
           named and labeled as orbit 3 data. The 'index/imgindx.tab' table   
           also reflects this inconsistency. There is no data for orbit 3.    
           The 'timeline/tllun004.xls' is the proper timeline file for this   
           orbit 4 data.                                                      
                                                                              
        DUPLICATE IMAGES                                                      
           A high percentage of duplicate images may occur for these          
           early orbits. This occurs in pairs where the first image is        
           uncompressed and the image immediately following is a compressed   
           version of the same data. For example, image lba0067y.001 and      
           lba0068y.001 are the same image data where lba0067y.001 is         
           uncompressed and lba0068y.001 is the compressed version of the     
           same data.                                                         
                                                                              
        All DNs ARE VALUE 255                                                 
           The image array for some imagery are all value 255.                
             (Note: Some images exist where most of the DN values             
              are saturated, however, a few pixels are not saturated.         
              For example, image lne0155p.001 contains 4 pixels with          
              value zero.)                                                    
                                                                              
        All DNs ARE VALUE 9 (ORBIT 001)                                       
           The image array are all value 9 for approximately 108 images.      
           This seems to occur on some images with FILTER_NAME='UNK". These   
           images have an underscore (_) in the third field of the filename.  
           For example, image lh_0076s.001 contains all 9's in the image      
           array. (A few of the images actually have a few DNs with value 10.)

           Due to periodic "stop/start" of imaging, slew maneuvers, exposure  
           tests, long script durations, and other operations, time gaps of   
           several minutes occur between some image pairs.

           The image array are all value 23 for approximately 184 images      
           throughout the orbit. (A few of the images actually have a few     
           DNs with value 22.)

        All DNs ARE VALUE 255                                                 
           The image array for some imagery are all value 255.                
                                                                              
        DUPLICATE IMAGES                                                      
           Duplicate images may occur for EARTH PHASING LOOP data.            
           As previously mentioned, this occurs in pairs where the first      
           image is uncompressed and the image immediately following is a     
           compressed version of the same data.
