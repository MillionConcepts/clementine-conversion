   Lunar polar coverage and the Clementine NIR Dataset
   ---------------------------------------------------
The processing steps for the NIR mosaics were applied to 
data from 70 degrees N to 70 degrees S only.  The polar 
regions were processed through 'standard' processing steps 
only, and the later empirical frame offset and 
multiplicative corrections were not applied.  This was due 
to multiple overlapping frame coverage and the difficulty 
in selecting optimal image coverage and deriving a single 
representative offset correction value for a given frame to 
be corrected.

   Planetary Data System Data Dictionary Keyword
    Discrepancies
   ---------------------------------------------------
EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE: For some images (.IMG files), the 
value for this keyword may be outside the current valid 
range. For example, for CD volume CL_5073 (on DVD DCL_5012) 
the image DATA/NI03S357.IMG contains a cartographically 
correct value of 360.0132 for EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE. This 
is beyond the current allowed maximum of 360. This occurs 
only for those images that contain the 0/360 longitude line 
and have a westernmost longitude smaller than 360.

At the time of release of this CD volume, the following PDS
image label keywords were not yet defined in the PDS Data
Dictionary. The definitions are being submitted for 
inclusion in the dictionary.

The Issue
---------

This report discusses discrepancies in map projection
Parameters found in the PDS labels on the Mars MDIM, 
Magellan F-Map (Venus), and Clementine Digital Map Products 
(Earth's Moon) produced by the USGS Astrogeology Team. This 
report is important for individuals needing to know the 
precise definition of the map projection and cartographic 
parameters that describe the image map. There are 
differences in the cartographic parameters in each of the 
data products that affect the algorithms defining the 
relationship between line and sample position in the image 
array and the latitude and longitude position on the planet 
surface.  Specifically, the LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and 
SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET parameters have inconsistent 
definitions among these data sets.

Additionally, as discussed below there are differences in 
the keywords names used to describe the map projection 
parameters on the PDS labels due to the evolution of PDS 
standards.

Data Products In Question
-------------------------

The Mars MDIM, Magellan F-Map, and Clementine Basemap and 
UVVIS Mosaics exist on CD media and are available for wide 
distribution to the NASA science community. These data sets 
contain global Mosaicked Digital Image Models (MDIM). The 
data sets are organized according to a "tiling" scheme that 
divides the planet into tiles (or quadrangles). Each tile 
represents a specific area on the planet. A tile is stored 
as a PDS-labeled image file. For more information on the 
data products, refer to the "volinfo.txt" file
located in the document directory on the CD volume sets.

Cartographic Keywords in the PDS Labels
---------------------------------------
The "IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION" object contained in a PDS label 
provides the cartographic parameters necessary to define 
any map projection.  For the Sinusoidal Equal-Area 
Projection only a subset of the cartographic keywords are 
required and parameters not applicable will contain "N/A" 
in the fields. The list below shows a typical 
IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION group of keywords. For precise 
definitions of the keywords, refer to the volinfo.txt file 
(located in the document directory) and the dsmap.cat file 
(located in the catalog directory.)

END

Because of the change in PDS standards the 
IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION group is different between the Mars 
MDIM products and the Magellan F-Map and Lunar MDIM 
products.  The Mars MDIM products were created before the 
"final" cartographic projection keywords were defined
and so they are different from the F-MAP and Lunar MDIM 
products. Here is a list of the differences in keyword 
names:

Mars MDIM Label                 F-MAP / Lunar MDIM Label
-----------------------------------------------------------
IMAGE_ID (in main label body)   changed to PRODUCT_ID
IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION_CATALOG    changed to
   IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION
DATA_SET_MAP_PROJECTION_CATALOG changed to
   DATA_SET_MAP_PROJECTION
X_AXIS_FIRST_PIXEL              changed to LINE_LAST_PIXEL
X_AXIS_LAST_PIXEL               changed to LINE_LAST_PIXEL
Y_AXIS_FIRST_PIXEL              changed to 
   SAMPLE_FIRST_PIXEL
Y_AXIS_LAST_PIXEL               changed to 
   SAMPLE_LAST_PIXEL
X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET        changed to 
   LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET
Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET        changed to 
   SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET

Discrepancies with Offset Parameters
-------------------------------------
The LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET 
parameters have inconsistent definitions among the 
Clementine, F-Map and Mars MDIM data products. This section 
describes the differences.

For the Mars MDIM, the offset parameters (called 
X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET and Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET) are 
used to define line and sample number as a function of 
latitude and longitude:

line   = INT(X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET - LAT*MAP_RESOLUTION 
         + 1.0)

sample = INT(Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET - (LON -
         CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*COS(LAT) + 1.0)

Note that the addition of 1.0 is part of the equation. This 
means the X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET and 
Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET are relative to line and sample 
0,0 in the image array. Because the direction of positive 
longitude is to the west for Mars, there is a "-" after the 
Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET in the equation.

For the F-MAP, Clementine Basemap, and Clementine UVVIS the 
equations are defined as:

line   = INT(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - LAT*MAP_RESOLUTION)

sample = INT(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET + (LON -
         CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*COS(LAT))

Note that the addition of 1.0 is not part of the equation. 
This means that the offset parameters are relative to line 
and sample 1,1. Because the direction of positive longitude 
is to the east for Venus and the Moon, there is a "+" after 
the SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET term.

An additional discrepancy exists in the F-MAP volume set. 
The LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET 
parameters are actually the negative of the value that they 
should be.  A software patch has been included on the F-MAP 
CD-ROMs to correct the projection offset keywords. The name 
of the program is PATH and it is stored in the SOFTWARE 
directory on the F-MAP volumes.

   UPPER-CASE AND LOWER-CASE FILE NAMES AND DIRECTORIES
             ON CD & DVD VOLUMES THAT CONFORM TO
                   THE ISO-9660 STANDARDS

                      Eric M. Eliason
                         3/1/1997

Names of files stored on an ISO-9660 formatted CD or DVDs 
are different among computer systems and operating systems. 
Some systems use lower-case file names while other systems 
use upper-case file names. Here is a list of how various 
operating systems behave with file names:

Sun/Solaris    - File names and folders are lower-case 
                 lettering
Macintosh      - File names and folders are upper-case 
                 lettering
PC/Windows 95  - File names and folders have the first 
                 Letter upper-case followed by
                 lower-case lettering.
PC/MS-DOS      - File names and folders are upper-case 
                 lettering
PC/Windows 3.1 - File names and folders are lower-case 
                 lettering

Because of the inconsistent case lettering of file names it 
was decided to provide file and volume names in the image 
index files (index.tab and cumindex.tab) and the source 
image index file (srcindx.tab on final volume) to upper-
case lettering. Users desiring to build applications around 
these tables will need to convert the file name to the 
appropriate case for their systems.
