EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE: For some images (.IMG files), the value
for this keyword may be outside the current valid range. For
example, for CD volume CL_4003 the image DATA/UI87N330.IMG
contains the cartographically correct value of 360.0586 for
EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE. This is beyond the current allowed maximum
of 360. This occurs only for those images that contain the 0/360
longitude line and have a westernmost longitude smaller than 360.

At the time of release of this CD volume, the following PDS
image label keywords were not yet defined in the PDS Data
Dictionary. The definitions are being submitted for inclusion
in the dictionary.

The Issue
---------

This report discusses discrepancies in map projection parameters
found in the PDS labels on the Mars MDIM, Magellan F-Map (Venus),
and Clementine Digital Map Products (Earth's Moon) produced by
the USGS Astrogeology Team. This report is important for
individuals needing to know the precise definition of the map
projection and cartographic parameters that describe the image
map. There are differences in the cartographic parameters in
each of the data products that effect the algorithms defining
the relationship between line and sample position in the image
array and the latitude and longitude position on the planet
surface.  Specifically, the LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and
SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET parameters have inconsistent definitions
among these data sets.

Additionally, as discussed below there are differences in the
keywords names used to describe the map projection parameters on
the PDS labels due to the evolution of PDS standards.

Data Products In Question
-------------------------

The Mars MDIM, Magellan F-Map, and Clementine Basemap and UVVIS
Mosaiacs exist on CD media and are available for wide distribution
to the NASA science community. These data sets contain global
Mosaicked Digital Image Models (MDIM). The data sets are organized
according to a "tiling"  scheme that divides the planet into tiles
(or quadrangles). Each tile represents a specific area on the
planet. A tile is stored as a PDS-labeled image file. For more
information on the data products, refer to the "volinfo.txt" file
located in the document directory on the CD volume sets.

Cartographic Keywords in the PDS Labels
---------------------------------------
The "IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION" object contained in a PDS label provides
the cartographic parameters necessary to define any map projection.
For the Sinusoidal Equal-Area Projection only a subset of the
cartographic keywords are required and parameters not applicable
will contain "N/A" in the fields. The list below shows a
typical IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION group of keywords. For precise
definitions of the keywords, refer to the volinfo.txt file
(located in the document directory) and the dsmap.cat file (located
in the catalog directory.)

  SECOND_STANDARD_PARALLEL     = "N/A"
  POSITIVE_LONGITUDE_DIRECTION = EAST
  CENTER_LATITUDE              = 0.00000
  CENTER_LONGITUDE             = 150.00000
  REFERENCE_LATITUDE           = "N/A"
  REFERENCE_LONGITUDE          = "N/A"
  LINE_FIRST_PIXEL             = 1
  SAMPLE_FIRST_PIXEL           = 1
  LINE_LAST_PIXEL              = 2830
  SAMPLE_LAST_PIXEL            = 2410
  MAP_PROJECTION_ROTATION      = 0.00000
  VERTICAL_FRAMELET_OFFSET     = 1
  HORIZONTAL_FRAMELET_OFFSET   = 6
END_OBJECT                     = IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION
END

Because of the change in PDS standards the IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION
group is different between the Mars MDIM products and the Magellan
F-Map and Lunar MDIM products. The Mars MDIM products were created
before the "final" cartographic projection keywords were defined
and so they are different from the F-MAP and Lunar MDIM
products. Here is a list of the differences in keyword names:

Mars MDIM Label                       F-MAP / Lunar MDIM Label
-------------------------------------------------------------------
IMAGE_ID (in main label body)   changed to PRODUCT_ID
IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION_CATALOG    changed to IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION
DATA_SET_MAP_PROJECTION_CATALOG changed to DATA_SET_MAP_PROJECTION
X_AXIS_FIRST_PIXEL              changed to LINE_LAST_PIXEL
X_AXIS_LAST_PIXEL               changed to LINE_LAST_PIXEL
Y_AXIS_FIRST_PIXEL              changed to SAMPLE_FIRST_PIXEL
Y_AXIS_LAST_PIXEL               changed to SAMPLE_LAST_PIXEL
X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET        changed to LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET
Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET        changed to SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET

Discrepancies with Offset Parameters
-------------------------------------
The LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET parameters
have inconsistent definitions among the Clementine, F-Map and Mars
MDIM data products. This section describes the differences.

For the Mars MDIM, the offset parameters (called
X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET and Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET) are used to
define line and sample number as a function of latitude and
longitude:

 line   = INT(X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET - LAT*MAP_RESOLUTION + 1.0)

 sample = INT(Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET - (LON -
          CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*COS(LAT) + 1.0)

Note that the addition of 1.0 is part of the equation. This means
the X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET and Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET are
relative to line and sample 0,0 in the image array. Because the
direction of positive longitude is to the west for Mars, there
is a "-" after the Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET in the equation.

For the F-MAP, Clementine Basemap, and Clementine UVVIS the
equations are defined as:

line   = INT(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - LAT*MAP_RESOLUTION)

sample = INT(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET + (LON -
          CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*COS(LAT))

Note that the addition of 1.0 is not part of the equation. This
means that the offset parameters are relative to line and sample
1,1. Because the direction of positive longitude is to the east
for Venus and the Moon, there is a "+"  after the
SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET term.

An additional discrepancy exists in the F-MAP volume set. The
LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET parameters
are actually the negative of the value that they should be.
A software patch has been included on the F-MAP CD-ROMs to
correct the projection offset keywords. The name of the program
is PATH and it is stored in the SOFTWARE directory on the
F-MAP volumes.

       UPPER-CASE AND LOWER-CASE FILE NAMES AND DIRECTORIES
                     ON CD VOLUMES THAT CONFORM TO
                        THE ISO-9660 STANDARDS

                           Eric M. Eliason
                              3/1/1997


Names of files stored on an ISO-9660 formatted CD are
different among computer systems and operating systems. Some
systems use lower-case file names while other systems use upper-
case file names. Here is a list of how various operating systems
behave with file names:

Sun/Solaris    - File names and folders are lower-case lettering
Macintosh      - File names and folders are upper-case lettering
PC/Windows 95  - File names and folders have the first letter
                 upper-case followed by lower-case lettering.
PC/MS-DOS      - File names and folders are upper-case lettering
PC/Windows 3.1 - File names and folders are lower-case lettering

Because of the inconsistent case lettering of file names it was
decided to provide file and volume names in the image index files
(index.tab and cumindex.tab) and the source image index file
(srcindx.tab on final volume) to upper-case lettering. Users
desiring to build applications around these tables will need to
convert the file name to the appropriate case for their systems.
