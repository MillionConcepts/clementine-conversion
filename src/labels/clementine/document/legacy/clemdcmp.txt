     CLEMDCMP will decompress a clementine image and format it into           
one of four possible formats:                                                 
                                                                              
       1) decompressed pds image file, with pds labels, the histogram         
           object, and an image object, either the browse image or            
           the full image                                                     
       2) decompressed raw image file, no labels                              
       3) decompressed tiff image                                             
       4) decompressed gif image                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Installing and Using Software on an IBM PC Running MS-DOS                     
                                                                              
    The file CLEMDCMP.EXE can be run as is directly from the CD-ROM.          
The CLEMDCMP.EXE software was created using Version 4.0 of the Borland C/C++  
development software.  It was compiled and linked using the large memory      
model.  This program has been tested on an IBM PC 486 using DOS 6.1.  The     
source is in the PC/SOURCE subdirectory.  A make file called CLEMDCMP.MAK     
has also been provided in the same directory.                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
CLEMDCMP has four command-line arguments.  The first argument indicates the   
output format of the decompressed image and the following are the options:    
         -p = decompressed pds image file                                     
         -n = decompressed unlabeled file                                     
         -t = decompressed tiff file                                          
         -g = decompressed gif file                                           
                                                                              
The second argument indicates which image object to output:                   
         -i = full resolution image                                           
         -b = browse image                                                    
The third argument is the filename of the input compressed clementine         
         data file.                                                           
The fourth argument is the filename of the output decompressed                
         clementine image.
