This CD (CL_3015) contains the most up to date errata information
regarding the Clementine UVVIS 750-nm CD volume set (CL_3001 through
CL_3015). The ERRATA.TXT file (this document) has been updated
to reflect current errata and other pertinent information.

###################################################################

       MODIFIED AAREADME.TXT ADDED TO VOLUME 15 (CL_3015)
       --------------------------------------------------
A slightly modified AAREADME.TXT has been included on the final
volume (CL_3015) for this CD set. Section 4, "CD CONTENTS, DIRECTORY,
AND FILENAMING CONVENTION", has been updated to document filenaming
conventions for orthographic products. The same section has been
updated to reflect the implementation of a full browse capability
as discussed in the "INTRODUCTION" section of the AAREADME.TXT
file on volume 15.


            KEYWORD DISCREPANCY IN BROWSE INFORMATION
            -----------------------------------------
This discrepancy refers only to HTML files presented in the BROWSE
directory tree of the Clementine CD volumes. When using a web-
browser application to view large and medium browse images, a table
of information is displayed with each image. Within this table,
there is a units discrepancy with the MAP SCALE and MAP RESOLUTION
keywords. The units as listed are correctly associated with the
displayed values, however, the keyword is incorrect. MAP SCALE
should say MAP RESOLUTION and visa versa.


            IMAGE INDEX FILENAMES AND KEYWORD VALUES
            ----------------------------------------
As described in the VOLINFO files in the DOCUMENT directory,
the IMGINDX.TAB file in the INDEX directory contains catalog
information for each data product provided within this CD
volume set. For CD volumes 1 through 14, incorrect filenames and
an incorrect keyword value exists in the index file for entries
with PRODUCT_IDs of BJ90A180.IMG, BM90A180.IMG, and BQ90A180.IMG.
These are south polar products in orthographic projection at various
resolutions. The CENTER_LONGITUDE element has an incorrect value of
180.0 degrees longitude. The correct value is 0.0. The actual file
names on the CD reflect this correct center longitude value
(BJ90A000.IMG, BM90A000.IMG, and BQ90A000.IMG). Also, the actual image
product PDS label contains the correct center longitude value.
Again, this applies only to the orthographic products mentioned.
Volume 15 (CL_3015), the final CD volume for this set, contains the
corrected IMGINDX.TAB file that reflects accurate filenames and center
longitude values.

The new IMGINDX.TAB file on volume 15 also contains updated values
for products BQ90B000.IMG and BQ90A000.IMG. These are orthographic
products on volume 15 only. The number of lines and number of
samples for each image was off by 1 in earlier IMGINDX.TAB files.


   PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM DATA DICTIONARY KEYWORD DISCREPANCIES
   -----------------------------------------------------------
EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE: For some images (.IMG files), the value
for this keyword may be outside the current valid range. For
example, for this CD volume the image BM90_90/BM14N345.IMG contains
the cartographically correct value of 360.0823975 for
EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE. This is beyond the current allowed maximum
of 360. This occurs only for those images that contain the 0/360
longitude line and have a westernmost longitude smaller than 360.

At the time of release of this CD volume, the following PDS
image label keywords were not yet defined in the PDS Data
Dictionary. The definitions are being submitted for inclusion
in the dictionary.

       BAND_NAME
       NULL
       LOW_REPR_SATURATION
       LOW_INSTR_SATURATION
       HIGH_INSTR_SATURATION
       HIGH_REPR_SATURATION


           KEYWORD VALUES FOR POLAR ORTHOGRAPHIC IMAGES
           --------------------------------------------
This section pertains only to Polar Stereographic images on CD
volumes CL_3001, CL_3014, and CL_3015. The following images have
keyword value discrepancies as noted.

   For image POLAR/BJ90B000.IMG on CL_3001, the CENTER_LATITUDE
   keyword value should be 90.0 (not 0.0).

   For image POLAR/BJ90A000.IMG on CL_3014, the CENTER_LATITUDE
   keyword value should be -90.0 (not 0.0).

   For images POLAR/BM90B000.IMG and POLAR/BQ90B000.IMG on CL_3015,
   the CENTER_LATITUDE keyword value should be 90.0 (not 0.0).

   For images POLAR/BM90A000.IMG and POLAR/BQ90A000.IMG on CL_3015,
   the CENTER_LATITUDE keyword value should be -90.0 (not 0.0).

   For all Polar Stereographic images mentioned above, the
   MAP_PROJECTION_TYPE keyword value should be ORTHOGRAPHIC
   (not NULL). The INDEX/IMGINDX.TAB table on volume 15 reflects
   the correct value.

DISCREPANCIES OF PROJECTION OFFSET PARAMETERS AMONG USGS-PRODUCED
                     PLANETARY DIGITAL GLOBAL MAPS

                           Eric M. Eliason
                              7/1/1997


The Issue
---------

This report discusses discrepancies in map projection parameters
found in the PDS labels on the Mars MDIM, Magellan F-Map (Venus),
and Clementine Base Map Mosaic (Earth's Moon) produced by the USGS
Astrogeology Team. This report is important for individuals
needing to know the precise definition of the map projection and
cartographic parameters that describe the image map. There are
differences in the cartographic parameters in each of the data
products that effect the algorithms defining the relationship
between line and sample position in the image array and the
latitude and longitude position on the planet surface.
Specifically, the LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and
SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET parameters have inconsistent definitions
among these data sets.

Additionally, as discussed below there are differences in the
keywords names used to describe the map projection parameters on
the PDS labels due to the evolution of PDS standards.

Data Products In Question
-------------------------

The Mars MDIM, Magellan F-Map, and Clementine Basemap Mosaic exist
on CD media and are available for wide distribution to the
NASA science community. These data sets contain global Mosaicked
Digital Image Models (MDIM). The data sets are organized according
to a "tiling"  scheme that divides the planet into tiles (or
quadrangles). Each tile represents a specific area on the planet. A
tile is stored as a PDS-labeled image file. For more information on
the data products, refer to the "volinfo.txt" file located in the
document directory on the CD volume sets.

Cartographic Keywords in the PDS Labels
---------------------------------------
The "IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION" object contained in a PDS label provides
the cartographic parameters necessary to define any map projection.
For the Sinusoidal Equal-Area Projection only a subset of the
cartographic keywords are required and parameters not applicable
will contain "N/A" in the fields. The list below shows a
typical IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION group of keywords. For precise
definitions of the keywords, refer to the volinfo.txt file
(located in the document directory) and the dsmap.cat file (located
in the catalog directory.)

  FIRST_STANDARD_PARALLEL      = "N/A"
  SECOND_STANDARD_PARALLEL     = "N/A"
  POSITIVE_LONGITUDE_DIRECTION = EAST
  CENTER_LATITUDE              = 0.00000
  CENTER_LONGITUDE             = 150.00000
  REFERENCE_LATITUDE           = "N/A"
  REFERENCE_LONGITUDE          = "N/A"
  LINE_FIRST_PIXEL             = 1
  SAMPLE_FIRST_PIXEL           = 1
  LINE_LAST_PIXEL              = 2830
  SAMPLE_LAST_PIXEL            = 2410
  MAP_PROJECTION_ROTATION      = 0.00000
  VERTICAL_FRAMELET_OFFSET     = 1
  HORIZONTAL_FRAMELET_OFFSET   = 6
END_OBJECT                     = IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION
END

Because of the change in PDS standards the IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION
group is different between the Mars MDIM products and the Magellan
F-Map and Lunar MDIM products. The Mars MDIM products were created
before the "final" cartographic projection keywords were defined
and so they are different from the F-MAP and Lunar MDIM
products. Here is a list of the differences in keyword names:

Mars MDIM Label                       F-MAP / Lunar MDIM Label
-------------------------------------------------------------------
IMAGE_ID (in main label body)   changed to PRODUCT_ID
IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION_CATALOG    changed to IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION
DATA_SET_MAP_PROJECTION_CATALOG changed to DATA_SET_MAP_PROJECTION
X_AXIS_FIRST_PIXEL              changed to LINE_LAST_PIXEL
X_AXIS_LAST_PIXEL               changed to LINE_LAST_PIXEL
Y_AXIS_FIRST_PIXEL              changed to SAMPLE_FIRST_PIXEL
Y_AXIS_LAST_PIXEL               changed to SAMPLE_LAST_PIXEL
X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET        changed to LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET
Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET        changed to SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET

Discrepancies with Offset Parameters
-------------------------------------
The LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET parameters
have inconsistent definitions among the Clementine, F-Map and Mars
MDIM data products. This section describes the differences.

For the Mars MDIM, the offset parameters (called
X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET and Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET) are used to
define line and sample number as a function of latitude and
longitude:

 line   = INT(X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET - LAT*MAP_RESOLUTION + 1.0)

 sample = INT(Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET - (LON -
          CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*COS(LAT) + 1.0)

Note that the addition of 1.0 is part of the equation. This means
the X_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET and Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET are
relative to line and sample 0,0 in the image array. Because the
direction of positive longitude is to the west for Mars, there
is a "-" after the Y_AXIS_PROJECTION_OFFSET in the equation.

For the F-MAP and Clementine basemap the equations are defined as:

line   = INT(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - LAT*MAP_RESOLUTION)

sample = INT(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET + (LON -
          CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*COS(LAT))

Note that the addition of 1.0 is not part of the equation. This
means that the offset parameters are relative to line and sample
1,1. Because the direction of positive longitude is to the east
for Venus and the Moon, there is a "+"  after the
SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET term.

An additional discrepancy exists in the F-MAP volume set. The
LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET parameters
are actually the negative of the value that they should be.
A software patch has been included on the F-MAP CD-ROMs to
correct the projection offset keywords. The name of the program
is PATH and it is stored in the SOFTWARE directory on the
F-MAP volumes.

       UPPER-CASE AND LOWER-CASE FILE NAMES AND DIRECTORIES
                     ON CD VOLUMES THAT CONFORM TO
                        THE ISO-9660 STANDARDS

                           Eric M. Eliason
                              3/1/1997


Names of files stored on an ISO-9660 formatted CD are
different among computer systems and operating systems. Some
systems use lower-case file names while other systems use upper-
case file names. Here is a list of how popular operating behave
with file names:

Sun/Solaris    - File names and folders are lower-case lettering
Macintosh      - File names and folders are upper-case lettering
PC/Windows 95  - File names and folders have the first letter
                 upper-case followed by lower-case lettering.
PC/MS-DOS      - File names and folders are upper-case lettering
PC/Windows 3.1 - File names and folders are lower-case lettering

Because of the inconsistent case lettering of file names it was
decided to provide file and volume names in the image index file
(imgindx.tab) and the source image index file (srcindx.tab) to
upper-case lettering. Users desiring to build applications around
these tables will need to convert the file name to the appropriate
case for their systems.
