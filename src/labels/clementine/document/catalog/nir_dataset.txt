    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Clementine NIR DIM Mosaic is a full-resolution (100 meters
      per pixel),radiometrically and geometrically controlled,
      photometrically modeled global mosaic produced by the U.S.
      Geological Survey from Clementine EDR Data. Imaging data
      acquired by the Near-Infrared Camera were used to create the
      multi-band mosaic.

      The NIR mosaic is mapped in the Sinusoidal Equal-Area
      Projection and partitioned into 996 quadrangles (quads) or
      “tiles” equivalent to those of the previously released 750-nm
      UVVIS basemap (PDS CD volumes CL_3001 through CL_3015) and the
      UVVIS DEM (PDS CD volumes CL_4001 through CL_4078). This
      100 m/pixel version of the NIR DIM is presented on 13 DVD
      volumes (equivalent to 78 ‘virtual CD’ volumes). Although the
      tiling scheme is identical to the original basemap, each 30-
      degree longitudinal section of the basemap now represents one DVD
      volume (equivalent to 6 virtual CD volumes). For each full
      resolution image product, subsampled enhanced color and
      comparative ratio ‘browse’ images are provided in Joint
      Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format. Reduced-resolution
      planet-wide NIR mosaics (e.g., at 0.5, 2.5, and 12.5 km/pixels)
      will be made available online at the PDS Map-a-Planet Web site
      (http://pdsmaps.wr.usgs.gov/maps.html) along with the full
      resolution NIR mosaic.

      In general, this design consists of rectangular tiles that
      are roughly 2100 pixels on a side. The actual tile size varies
      with latitude. Near the equator, each tile covers 7 degrees of
      latitude and 6 degrees of longitude. A typical full-resolution
      6-band tile requires ~58 megabytes of digital storage.

    
    Parameters

    Processing
    ==========
      As was the case for the UVVIS mosaic, the U.S. Geological
      Survey Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS)
      processing system was used to generate the NIR mosaic. Because
      the final steps of the NIR data processing followed the UVVIS
      processing by several years, the same version of ISIS (v.2.0,
      or 'Old ISIS') was frozen in place and used for both datasets.
      ISIS cartographic processing for the NIR mosaic includes
      radiometric correction, geometric control to the Clementine
      750-nm basemap mosaic, spectral registration, photometric
      normalization, and image mosaicking to produce near-seamless,
      uniformly illuminated views of the surface of the Moon at 6
      wavelengths. Radiometric correction applies 'flat fielding,'
      dark current subtraction, non-linearity correction, and
      conversion to radiometric units (usually radiance). Geometric
      transformations tie each raw image with the ground control
      network from the basemap mosaic and convert from raw image
      coordinates to the Sinusoidal Equal-Area projection.
      Photometric normalization is applied to balance brightness
      variations due to illumination differences among the images in
      a mosaic. The first four NIR bands (1100 to 2000 nm) have also
      been normalized to reflectance based on the approach previously
      applied to the calibrated UVVIS global mosaics. Images are then
      mosaicked together to form a global map of continuous image
      coverage for the entire planetary body.

    Media/Format
    ============
      The Clementine NIR mosaic is delivered to the Planetary Data
      System using DVD media. Formats are based on standards for
      such products established by the Planetary Data System (PDS)
      [PDSSR1992].  "

      Overview
      ========
      Both the Clementine NIR and UVVIS mosaics were geometrically
      controlled to the previously published 750-nm Clementine
      Basemap Mosaic (PDS volumes CL_3001 through CL_3015) by tying
      individual NIR images that make up a color set to the
      corresponding image used to produce the basemap mosaic. The
      750nm basemap mosaic was geometrically controlled using the
      methods described below. Although shortcomings have since been
      identified, the 750-nm basemap mosaic significantly improved
      the geometric control of the Moon from previous maps and ground
      control points. On the basis of best-effort measurements of the
      spacecraft orbit and pointing, UVVIS geometric distortions, and
      time tags for each observation, the Clementine Spacecraft,
      Planet Instrument, C-matrix, and Event kernels (SPICE) data
      alone provide positional accuracy better than 1 kilometer over
      most of the Moon.

      The geometric processing goal of the basemap was for 95% of the
      Moon (excluding the oblique observation gap fills) to have
      better than 0.5 km/pixel absolute positional accuracy and to
      adjust the camera angles so that all frames match neighboring
      frames to within an accuracy of 2 pixels. To achieve these
      goals, camera alignment and pointing data were required to be
      accurate to a few hundredths of a degree. The absolute
      alignment of the UVVIS was determined with respect to
      spacecraft-fixed axes (A and B Star Tracker Camera quaternions)
      by analyzing a major subset of the over 17,000 images of Vega,
      over 6,000 images of the Southern Cross, and a few hundred
      images of the Pleiades, taken during the approach to the Moon
      and throughout the lunar mapping phase of the Clementine
      mission. Multiple star images within a single picture were used
      to determine the UVVIS focal length and optical distortion
      parameter values.

      Approximately 265,000 match points were collected at the USGS
      from ~43,000 UVVIS 750 nm images providing global coverage.
      Approximately 80% of these points were collected via autonomous
      procedures, and the remaining 20% were collected manually. 
      Streamlined procedures for the supervised collection of match
      points were developed and applied, and these procedures saved
      several person-years of effort. The automated success rate
      exceeded 90% along each spacecraft orbit track, where the
      overlap regions of successive images are highly correlated, but
      failed when the overlap region is narrow and/or nearly
      featureless. ('Failure' is defined as less than 3 points per
      image with correlation coefficients greater than 0.85; thus,
      many good match points were rejected because we could not be 
      certain that the matches were valid without verification.)
      Across-track matching was more difficult due to changes in
      scale and illumination angle, but a fair success rate (~60%)
      was achieved via the use of 'window-shaping' (local geometric
      reprojections). The oblique gap-fill images were the most
      difficult to match and required substantial human intervention.
      Matching the polar regions was time-consuming because each
      frame overlaps many other frames. Most match point locations
      were found to a precision of 0.2 pixel.

      The USGS match points were provided to Tim Colvin and Mert
      Davies of the RAND Corporation for analytical triangulations.
      Using these match points, control points from the Apollo
      region, and the latest SPICE kernels from Navigation and
      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL, RAND determined
      improved camera orientation angles for the global set of UVVIS
      images. A constant lunar radius of 1737.4 kilometers was
      assumed, and this was later found to be a significant source of
      error near the oblique gap fills. The analytical triangulation
      is a least-squares formulation designed to adjust the latitude
      and longitude of the control points and the camera orientation
      angles to best fit the match points. The triangulation was
      first computed on 'packets' of match points (each covering
      about one-eighth of the Moon), then checked and rechecked at
      the USGS via plots and test mosaics to fix and add match points
      as needed. The final (global) analytical triangulation required
      the solution of ~660,000 normal equations. The mean error is 
      less than 1 pixel. This effort was by far the largest
      analytical triangulation ever applied to a planetary body other
      than Earth. The results defined the planimetric geometry of the
      750-nm basemap, to which all systematic Clementine mosaic
      products have been tied."
