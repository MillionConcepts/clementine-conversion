      is presented in a Sinusoidal Equal-Area map projection. In
      this projection, parallels of latitude are straight lines,
      with constant distances between equal latitude intervals.
      Lines of constant longitude on either side of the projection
      meridian are curved since longitude intervals decrease with
      the cosine of latitude to account for their convergence toward
      the poles. This projection offers a number of advantages for
      storing and managing global digital data; in particular, it is
      computationally simple, and data are stored in a compact form.

      The Sinusoidal Equal-Area projection is characterized by a
      projection longitude, which is the center meridian of the
      projection, and a scale, which is given in units of pixels/
      degree. A projection longitude is defined for each Clementine
      NIR quadrangle

      The transformation from latitude and longitude to line and
      sample is given by the following equations:

      line = INT(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - lat*MAP_RESOLUTION)

      sample = INT(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET + (lon -
               CENTER_LONGITUDE)*MAP_RESOLUTION*cos(lat))

      Note that integral values of line and sample correspond to the
      center of a pixel. Lat and lon are the latitude and longitude
      of a given spot on the surface.

      LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the line number minus one on which
      the map projection origin occurs. The map projection origin
      is the intersection of the equator and the projection 
      longitude. The value of LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for 
      images starting north of the equator and is negative for images
      starting south of the equator.

      SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the nearest sample number to the
      left of the projection longitude. The value of SAMPLE_
      PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for images starting to the west
      of the projection longitude and is negative for images starting
      to the east of the projection longitude.

      CENTER_LONGITUDE is the value of the projection longitude,
      which is the longitude that passes through the center of the
      projection.

      MAP_RESOLUTION is measured in pixels/degree.

      There are four PDS parameters that specify the latitude and
      longitude boundaries of an image.  MAXIMUM_LATITUDE and
      MINIMUM_LATITUDE specify the latitude boundaries of the image,
      and EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE and WESTERNMOST_LONGITUDE specify the
      longitudinal boundaries of the map.

      Definitions of other mapping parameters can be found in the
      PDS Data dictionary. "
