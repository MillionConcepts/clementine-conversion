    Instrument Overview
    ===================

      The Clementine Near Infrared (NIR) Camera used a catadioptric
      lens with a 256x256 indium antimonide (InSb) Focal Plane Array
      (FPA) mechanically cooled to cryogenic temperature. The FPA
      operated at 70 plus-or-minus 0.5 K at the Moon and showed
      excellent stability over the more than 500 hours of operation in
      space.  The lens design features all ZnSe refractive elements
      with a relay to provide an external pupil for 100% efficient cold
      shielding. This lens design was chosen for image quality and
      focus stability. Wavelength range was constrained by the optics
      and the InSb response to somewhat less than 1.0 to 5.5 microns.
      Six wavebands were selected by a NASA science advisory committee
      for discriminating among major lunar soil types, all falling
      well inside this wavelength range.

      Programmable camera electronics allowed 4 integration times, 5
      bits of gain, and 8 bits of offset. Gain states are spaced
      approximately evenly from 0.5 to 36 factors of voltage
      multiplication. Offset is subtracted before gain is applied
      with 0 V to full well range that can be set in 1/255 full well
      increments. The NIR camera performance specifications are shown
      below.


    Scientific Objectives
    =====================

      The primary scientific objective of the UVVIS and NIR imaging
      instruments was to support lunar mineral mapping investigations.
      Pole-to-pole NADIR observations with solar phase angles kept to
      less than 30 degrees at mid-latitudes were the predominant
      viewing conditions during the two month systematic mapping
      phase of the mission.  The UVVIS and NIR cameras provided nearly
      100% coverage of the lunar surface in 11 spectral bands ranging in
      wavelength from 415 to 2780 nm.  Image resolution ranges from
      about 135 meters/pixel at periselene (-28 degrees south latitude
      for the first month's observations, +28 degrees the second month)
      to 400 meters/pixel at the poles.


    Calibration
    ===========

      Radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal received
      from a camera (‘data number’ or DN value) into a quantity that
      is proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The
      sensitivity of the NIR CCD FPA varied across the field of view.
      The instrument response is sensitive to the temperatures of the
      FPA, optics, and cryocooler. During Clementine mission operations
      it was discovered that a sufficient cryocooler cool-down period
      was needed before temperatures of the instrument became stable.
      NIR images at the start of an observational pass over the Moon
      just prior to turning on the cryocooler may be difficult to
      calibrate due to temperature instabilities of the instrument.

      The NIR camera was calibrated prior to launch.  Laboratory
      observations of a flat field under various operating temperatures
      and camera operation modes provided information about the
      sensitivity of the camera under expected spaceflight conditions.
      Extensive pre-flight calibration data were acquired using an
      automated calibration facility at Lawrence Livermore National
      Laboratory (LLNL). In a typical calibration configuration, a
      sensor was mounted inside an environmental chamber whose
      temperature was set to -20 to 20 degrees C (the expected
      operating temperatures for the mission). Depending on the
      measurement types, the sensors saw either a flat diffused light
      source or an off-axis collimator with various pinholes as the
      point source. A custom board controlled the sensor parameters
      from the host computers; the video signal was acquired using a
      commercial image processor. During data acquisition many thermal
      parameters such as FPA and chamber temperatures were monitored
      and recorded as part of the image structure. The pre-flight
      calibration measurements included radiometric sensitivity; FPA
      uniformity; gain and offset scale factors; temporal & spatial
      noise; dark noise dependence on FPA temperatures, integration
      times, input voltage levels, spectral response of FPA; optical
      distortion map; point spread function; electronic warm-up time
      and cryocooler cool down time. Pre-flight calibration attempted
      to cover similar light levels expected from the lunar surface
      and spanning the same camera settings required for lunar mapping.  

      During inflight operations, a variety of calibration observations
      were made, including Apollo landing site observations where
      laboratory spectra of returned lunar samples have been measured.
      These data (especially those for the Apollo 16 highlands soils)
      were used to calibrate the first four filters of the NIR data.
      The longest NIR wavelengths (2600 and 2780 nm bands) were not
      normalized to these soil measurements because reflectance
      information was not available and may be complicated by the
      presence of thermal emission signatures at longer wavelengths.

      Before radiometric processing of the NIR data began, two effects
      specific to the NIR data were characterized: 1) instrument
      operating modes and 2) instrument thermal background changes
      during an orbital observation pass over the Moon.  The goal of
      the first characterization was to determine an optimum set of
      calibration constants to minimize the difference between
      calibrated values for portions of the Moon imaged sequentially
      with different camera settings.  The goal of the second
      characterization step was to isolate the thermal background
      changes during an orbital pass and to define a set of corrections
      for each orbit.  Compensation for these two effects was
      incorporated into the radiometric calibration steps, and residual
      effects were removed in later processing.
      
      To facilitate creation of NIR mosaics with uniform scene
      brightness, a photometric normalization procedure was applied to
      the individual NIR images.  The data were normalized to R30, the
      reflectance expected at an incidence angle (i) and phase angle (p)
      of 30.0 degrees and an emission angle (e) of 0.0 degrees matching
      the photometric geometry of lunar samples measured at the
      reflectance laboratory at Brown University.

      In addition to this 'standard' radiometric and photometric
      processing of the Clementine NIR data, empirically derived frame
      offset corrections were applied to reduce observed residual 
      variations across camera modes and adjacent orbits in the NIR
      mosaics.  

      Geometric calibration removes optical distortions of the
      imaging system.  The geometric distortion of the NIR camera has
      been shown to be minimal (maximum optical distortion does not
      exceed 3.0 pixels) and can be satisfactorily modeled by a 2nd
      order polynomial.

      calibration of the Clementine imaging systems, please review the

    Operational Considerations
    ==========================

      The pole-to-pole lunar observations provided scenes with a
      broad range of viewing conditions, ranging from bright
      observations near zero phase angle at the equator to very low
      light-level observations at the poles.  To properly record an
      observation with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio it is important
      to adequately fill the 8-bit (255 levels) dynamic range of the
      A/D camera output.  The integration time (exposure time) and the
      gain and offset operating modes of the instrument were adjusted
      to properly record each image.  Lunar observations were broken
      into 10 latitude bins.  Each latitude bin contained fixed gain
      and offset modes and integration times for each camera/filter
      combination.

      The Clementine orbit was designed to provide overlapping
      coverage in both the down-track (~15% overlap) and cross-track
      (~10% overlap at the equator) directions.  The image overlap is
      necessary to geometrically control images in cartographic
      applications.


    Operational Modes
    =================
      The NIR camera had three operating modes:
 
      1. Four selectable image integration times (11, 33, 57, 95 ms).
 
      2. Gain Mode. The gain mode represents the multiplicative
      constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D
      converter.  Thirty two (5 bit) gain state settings were
      available.
 
      3. Offset Mode. The offset mode represents the additive constant
      applied to the image data passing through the A/D converter.
      There were 256 (8 bit) offset mode settings.
