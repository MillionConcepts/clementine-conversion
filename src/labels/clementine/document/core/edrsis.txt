This Software Interface Specification (SIS) describes the organization        
and contents of the Clementine EDR (Experimental Data Record) Image data      
products. There are six cameras onboard the Clementine spacecraft that        
will produce image data: 1) A-Star-tracker camera (A-STAR), 2) B-Star-        
tracker camera (B-STAR), 3) LIDAR High-resolution camera (HiRes), 4)          
ultraviolet / Visible camera (UVVIS), 5) Near Infrared camera (NIR), and      
6) the Long Wavelength Infrared Camera (LWIR).  The Clementine EDR Data       
products are deliverable products to the Planetary Data System and the        
scientific community that it supports. All data formats are based on the      
PDS standard, version 3.0, as documented in the PDS Standards Reference       
[JPL Document D-7669, November 1992, available through the PDS].

This specification is useful to those who wish to understand the format       
and content of the Clementine EDR Image data products. Typically, these

1.4.1 DATA CONTENT SUMMARY                                                    
                                                                              
Each Clementine EDR data product consists of a single camera                  
observation.  The image data have been depacketized and reformatted with      
standard PDS labels, but are otherwise "raw". Raw data contain the            
geometric and radiometric characteristics of unprocessed and unrectified      
data. To make full utilization of the data, it is necessary to perform        
radiometric and geometric processing on the data products.                    
                                                                              
The imaging sensors are framing cameras using CCD technology. The Star        
tracking cameras (A-STAR and B-STAR) are used for spacecraft navigation       
and orientation. The science observation cameras (UVVIS, HIRES, NIR, and      
LWIR) acquire images in a wide spectral range from 415 to 8750                
nanometers. The UVVIS, HIRES, and NIR cameras have filter wheels that         
allow images to be acquired under six spectral filters. The LWIR camera       
has a single spectral filter. Table 1 shows the pixel dimensions of the       
images acquired by each camera and the center wavelength of each filter       
wheel position. Other than the image dimensions, the data products of         
each camera are identically formatted.

1.4.2 DATA SOURCE AND TRANSFER METHOD                                         
                                                                              
Clementine imaging data products are produced by the Clementine Mission       
Operations Center operated by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The        
"NRL-ACT-MGRAB" software converts the data to the proper PDS labeled          
format.                                                                       
                                                                              
1.4.3 DATA RECIPIENTS AND UTILIZATION                                         
                                                                              
The Clementine EDR data products are made available to NRL scientists         
and the NASA/Clementine Science team for initial evaluation and               
validation. At the end of the evaluation and validation period, the data      
are organized and stored on compact disc (CD) media and made available        
to the PDS for distribution to the science community. These products          
will be used for engineering support, direct science analysis, and            
construction of other science products.                                       
                                                                              
1.5 ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS                                               
                                                                              
The Clementine EDR data products contain compressed image data.               
Decompression will result in a raw image that is not corrected for            
instrument signature, effects of spacecraft motion, or effects of             
imaging geometry. Although there is enough information in the header to       
perform some processing, for more sophisticated processing, ancillary         
data will be required. Examples of ancillary files are calibration            
files, viewing geometry files, (e.g. SPICE kernels), image index tables,      
etc.                                                                          
                                                                              
2. ENVIRONMENT                                                                
                                                                              
The Clementine EDR data products are stored on CD media according to the      
ISO 9660 Volume and Directory Standard. This standard is compatible on        
virtually all modern hardware platforms including UNIX, IBM/PC, and           
Macintosh computer environments.                                              
                                                                              
The file headers contained on the Clementine CD-ROMs do not include           
extended attribute records (XAR). This means that VAX/VMS systems can         
not readily access the files. Without XARs, record attributes can not be      
associated with a file. VAX/VMS directory listings of these files will        
show  "Record Attributes: None, Record Format: None" file                     
characteristics.                                                              
                                                                              
3. ACCESS                                                                     
                                                                              
The primary barrier or access to the Clementine EDR data products is the      
compressed format of the image data. Thus, decompression software is          
available on the archive to perform decompression. This software              
produces decompressed image files in a standard PDS format. The software      
will run on a variety of computer platforms.

Each product will have a file name of the form "msfxxxxy.rrr". The file       
name is unique across all Clementine EDR data products. For more              
information on the file name refer to the PRODUCT_ID keyword definition       
in section 4.3.2. The product also contains a data set id that                
identifies the data set. For more information on the data set id see the      
DATASET_ID keyword definition in section 4.3.2.                               
                                                                              
4.2 STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW                                       
                                                                              
The Clementine EDR data products are constructed according to the data        
object concepts developed by the PDS. By adopting the PDS format, the         
Clementine EDR images are consistent in content and organization with         
other planetary image collections. In the PDS standard, the EDR image         
file is grouped into objects with PDS labels describing the objects. The      
Clementine EDR data products contain 1) an image object (the primary          
data), 2) a browse image object, and 3) an image histogram object. The        
image object contains the observed image data. The image data will exist      
in a compressed form (if the data are compressed on board the                 
spacecraft), or an uncompressed form (if the data are not compressed on       
the spacecraft). The browse image object contains an uncompressed image       
of the original data that has been reduced in size by subsampling the         
image array. The browse image provides the capability to rapidly view         
the image collection at a reduced format. The image histogram object          
contains the histogram of the image after decompression. The image            
histogram object can be used to obtain statistical information about the      
image.                                                                        
                                                                              
A description of the data compression coefficients used on the                
Clementine images is described in Appendix II.

The label area of the data file conforms to the PDS version 3 standards.      
For more information on this standard consult the PDS Standards               
Reference JPL D-7669 Document. The purpose of the PDS label is to             
describe the data product and provide ancillary information about the         
data product. An example of a PDS label is shown below:

                  from the spacecraft's solid state data recorder. This       
                  field specifies a sequence number, starting with 1, of

     temporary file names and product id's. This keyword contains the         
     temporary product_id (and file name) given to the image. This field      
     should be ignored by all new users of the Clementine data products.      
     The format is similar to the PRODUCT_ID. The 'xxxxx' field               
     represents a sequence number. There were several problems                
     associated with this number. The sequence numbers refer to the           
     order in which the data were send down from the spacecraft and           
     not the order in which the images were acquired in orbit. Due to         
     ground processing problems, the sequence numbers in the original         
     product id have been shown to be unreliable.

     Data Quality indicator. This keyword is reserved for future use.         
     As processing of Clementine data proceeds, this keyword may              
     be used to describe data quality information. No data quality            
     parameters have currently been defined.                                  
                                                                              
TARGET_NAME = "xxxxxx"                                                        
                                                                              
     Observational target: MOON, EARTH, SKY                                   
                                                                              
     The TARGET body is determined by the PICGEO program algorithm:           
                                                                              
     1) For each possible target body (a target selection list is             
     specified to the PICGEO program), it determines if the body is           
     partly or entirely in the camera's field of view.                        
                                                                              
     2) If only one body is in the field of view, that body is the            
     target body.                                                             
                                                                              
     3) If multiple bodies are in the field of view, and one or more          
     bodies intersect the camera boresight, the closest one to the S/C        
     is the target body.                                                      
                                                                              
     4) If multiple bodies are in the field of view, and no bodies            
     intersect the camera boresight, the closest one to the S/C is the        
     target body.                                                             
                                                                              
     5) If no bodies are in the camera's field of view, the target            
     body is 'SKY'.                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
REVOLUTION_NUMBER = xxx                                                       
     The revolution number refers to an observational pass over the           
     moon. The revolution number is incremented by one each time the          
     spacecraft passes over the south pole prior to the beginning of          
     data acquisition. REVOLUTION_NUMBER is used in lieu of orbit             
     number because of the way the orbit number was defined by the            
     mission. The orbit number is incremented at the equator on the           
     sun lit side of the Moon. Thus, the orbit number is changed in           
     the middle of an observational pass. This proved to be awkward           
     in defining the data acquired by a single pass over the Moon.            
                                                                              
                                                                              
FRAME_SEQUENCE_NUMBER = xxxxxx                                                
     Sequential frame number of the image acquired during a pass over         
     the Moon. For non-lunar mapping phase of mission the sequence            
     number refers to the image sequence within a spacecraft memory           
     download.

     Time of start of observation. This time refers to the start              
     of the integration time of the camera. The value contained in this       
     keyword reflects a "corrected time". A software problem onboard          
     the spacecraft caused inaccurate times to be attached to an image.       
     This value contains the best estimated time of the observation.

UNCORRECTED_START_TIME = 1994-01-01T03:24:10.444Z                             
     This keyword contains the time of the observation as sent down           
     by the spacecraft. This time may be incorrect due to a software          
     problem that existed onboard the spacecraft. The difference between      
     the START_TIME and the UNCORRECTED_START_TIME is the estimated           
     correction that was applied to the START_TIME.

     vector, evaluated at the camera epoch minus one-way light time from      
     target to spacecraft at that epoch spacecraft at that epoch.             
     Azimuth is measured as described above.  Target body position            
     relative to the spacecraft is corrected for light-time and stellar       
     aberration.  Target body orientation is corrected for light-time.

     Planetocentric latitude and longitude of the apparent sub-solar          
     point.

EMISSION_ANGLE  = xxxx.xx <deg>                                               
     These angles are measured at the camera boresight intercept point.       
     The target-Sun vector is the same as that used in the sub-solar          
     point computation.  The spacecraft-target vector is the same as          
     that used in the camera boresight intercept computation.                 
     The INCIDENCE ANGLE is the angle between the target-Sun vector and       
     the local vertical vector at the boresight intercept.                    
     The PHASE ANGLE is measured between the boresight intercept-to-Sun       
     vector and the negative of the boresight vector.                         
     The EMISSION ANGLE is measured between the negative of the               
     boresight vector and the local vertical vector at the boresight          
     intercept.

     projection of the negative of the spacecraft-to-target vector onto       
     the target's instantaneous orbital plane.  Both vectors are              
     computed as in the sub-spacecraft point computation.  The angle is       
     measured in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from North of       
     the ecliptic plane.

These keywords describe the image object. Data are in a compressed            
form, the huffman table, and DCT coefficients are stored in the               
object. Access to this object is through the decompression software.          
MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MEAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION refers to the DN values        
of the image array. The CHECKSUM parameter refers to the sum of the           
bytes in the object in compressed form. The ENCODING_COMPRESSION_RATIO        
specifies the compression factor of the data. There are three permitted       
values for the ENCODING_TYPE: "N/A" indicates the image was not               
compressed on the spacecraft and so the data are not in a compressed          
format. "CLEM-JPEG-0" and "CLEM-JPEG-1" indicates the data were               
compressed onboard the spacecraft and the data are stored in a                
compressed form. See Appendix II for a description of the two data            
decompression forms.

The following SPICE kernel files were inputs to the Picture Geometry          
program (PICGEO) used to compute the geometric quantities found in the        
PDS image labels and the Image Index files (IMGINDX.TAB) archived in          
this volume set. Improvements to some of these fundamental ancillary          
data will be made as further analysis of Clementine data continues, so        
the geometric quantities found in the labels should not be used for           
precision science data analyses.

produced by the Naval Research Laboratory, based on orbit solutions           
provided by the Goddard Space Flight Center Flight Dynamics Facility.         
The NRL data, given in the SERF form, were converted to the SPICE SPK

Clementine spacecraft orientation file. The pointing in this file is          
discrete, stored every 5 seconds during periods of imaging and every 60       
seconds during periods of non-imaging. There are gaps in coverage. The        
pointing data in this file were NOT corrected for known discrepancies         
between A- and B- star tracker alignment. The data are in SPICE CK

Planetary constants kernel file, in the SPICE text-PcK format. This was       
used for modeling the size, shape and orientation of the earth, and the       
size and shape (not orientation) of the moon.

Lunar orientation model using numerically integrated physical                 
librations. This model uses the mean earth axes, not the principal axes       
used in the IAU publications from which the pck00003.tpc data were            
obtained. The difference between these two models is thought to be            
several hundred meters.

NAIF leapseconds kernel file, used for converting between Universal Time      
Coordinated (UTC) and Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB, also called            
Ephemeris Time, or ET).                                                       
                                                                              
The seven instrument kernel files below contain the instrument mounting       
alignment relative to the spacecraft, and the following instrument            
geometric parameters: focal length, focal plane dimension, pixel size,        
and the coefficient of radially symmetric optical distortion.  ASTAR and

APPENDIX II - Data Compression Coefficients                                   
                                                                              
The Clementine Data Handling Unit (DHU) permits 4 data compression            
parameter sets to be loaded at any given time, i.e. Sets 0-3. These data      
compression parameter sets are used to drive the MATRA compression chip.      
This chip permits the real time compression of images using a                 
compression scheme that is similar to the JPEG standard  but not              
identical.                                                                    
                                                                              
Each data compression parameter set is composed of:                           
      TabQ table        - which contains 64 values                            
      Huffman Table     - which contains the huffman encoding constants,      
      TabF  vector      - which contains a vector with 16 possible            
                          scaling constants to use.                           
                                                                              
During the Clementine mission:                                                
                                                                              
<> Set 0 corresponded to MATRA's default data compression parameter set.      
   The ENCODING_TYPE = "CLEM-JPEG-0" signifies Set 0 parameters               
   were used in the compression.                                              
                                                                              
<> Set 1 corresponded to a flat quantization table for all frequencies.       
   This is the set that was primarily used during the whole mission.          
   The ENCODING_TYPE = "CLEM-JPEG-1" signifies Set 1 parameters               
   were used in the compression.                                              
                                                                              
<> Sets 2-3 were identical to Set 1.  If needed they were going to be         
   modified during flight.   After a number of quick studies, using           
   data from the first few orbits around the Moon, it was decided that        
   this was not needed.                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STANDARD JPEG AND THE MATRA IMPLEMENTATION           
                                                                              
Standard JPEG Frequency Quantization Scheme                                   
                                                                              
In the standard JPEG algorithm the frequency coefficients X(u,v) [using       
here a  notation similar to the one used in the English version of the        
MATRA chip manual] are transformed by the following equation before the       
frequency coefficients are Huffman encoded:                                   
                                                                              
      Xq(u,v) = int9bit[X(u,v)/q(u,v)]  (1)                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
where,                                                                        
                                                                              
X(u,v)   is a 12 bit signed number representing the DCT coefficient           
         at the frequency indices (u,v).                                      
q(u,v)   quantization table coefficient at the frequency index (u,v),         
         this is an 8 bit positive number (1-255).                            
                                                                              
In the decompression stage the value of X(u,v) is reconstructed from the      
following equation:                                                           
                                                                              
        Xr(u,v) = int9bit[X(u,v)/q(u,v)].q(u,v)                               
                                                                              
Equation (1) is a lossy operation due to the integer truncation.              
                                                                              
For the set of lunar test images we have been working with a small value      
of q(u,v), say q(u,v)=1,  results in compression ratios close to the          
original CLEMENTINE baseline requirement of 4 to 1.  Hence we were            
particular interested in looking at what is the smaller value of q'(u,v)      
that can be represented by the MATRA chip hardware.                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
MATRA's Implementations of the JPEG Frequency Quantization Scheme             
                                                                              
In the MATRA chip  the desired  quantization coefficient factor, q(u,v),      
is approximated in hardware using an effective  q'(u,v), i.e.                 
                                                                              
 Xq'(u,v) = int9bit[X(u,v)/q'(u,v)]                                           
          = int9bit[int8bit[ ((TABF*TABQ(u,v))/64))/4094)).X(u,v)] (2)        
                                                                              
                                                                              
where:                                                                        
TABF       is an 8 bit positive quantity used for scaling purposes,           
TABQ (u,v) is a derived 8 bit positive number defined by                      
                                                                              
   TABQ=int8bit[255*10/q(u,v)]                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
In other words, in the MATRA chip a desired JPEG quantization                 
coefficient value, q(u,v), is implemented as an  effective q'(u,v) value      
of:                                                                           
                                                                              
    q'(u,v)= 4094/(int8bit[TABF.TABQ/64])                                     
           = 4094/(int8bit[(TABF/64).int8bit[(255*10)/q(u,v)])                
             >= 4                                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
Notice that since TABF and TABQ are 8 bit positive numbers it follows         
that  4 <= q'(u,v).                                                           
                                                                              
Hence,  the minimum effective quantization table coefficient value            
achievable in the MATRA chip is four.
