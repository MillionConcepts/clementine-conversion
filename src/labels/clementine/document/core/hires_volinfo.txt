INTRODUCTION
============
This compact disk (CD) is one of 22 which comprise mosaics of the 
Clementine I high resolution (HiRes) camera images of the moon.  
These mosaics were produced through semi-automated registration 
and calibration against the recently released geometrically and 
photometrically controlled Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/Vis) Basemap 
Mosaic.  The HiRes mosaics were compiled from non-uniformity 
corrected, 750 nanometer ("D") filter high resolution nadir-
looking observations from the HiRes imaging system onboard the 
Clementine Spacecraft.  The images were spatially warped using 
the sinusoidal equal-area projection at a scale of 20 m/pixel for 
sub-polar mosaics (below 80 deg latitude) and using the 
stereographic projection at a scale of 30 m/pixel for polar 
mosaics.  To avoid the necessity of iterative reprojection, which 
was beyond the scope of the present effort, only images with 
emission angles less than approximately 5 degrees were used. 
Similarly, images from non-mapping cross-track slews, which 
tended to have large SPICE errors, were generally omitted. The 
locations of the resulting image population were offset from the 
UV/Vis basemap by up to 13 km (0.4 deg).

The geometric control was provided by the 100 m/pixel global and 
150 m/pixel polar U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) Clementine 
Basemap Mosaics compiled from the 750 nm Ultraviolet/Visible 
Clementine imaging system.  Calibration was achieved by removing 
the image nonuniformity dominated by the HiRes system's light 
intensifier.  Also provided are offset and scale factors, 
achieved by a fit of the HiRes data to the corresponding 
photometrically calibrated UV/Vis basemap, that approximately 
transform the 8-bit HiRes data to photometric units.

The sub-polar mosaics are divided into tiles that cover 
approximately 1.75 degrees of latitude and span the longitude 
range of the mosaicked frames.  Images from a given orbit are map 
projected using the orbit's nominal central latitude. Polar 
mosaics are tiled into squares 2250 pixels on a side, which spans 
approximately 2.2 degrees. Two mosaics are provided for each 
pole: one corresponding to south periapsis data, the other to 
north periapsis data.

This CD also contains ancillary data files that support the HiRes 
mosaic.  These files include browse images with UV/Vis context 
stored in a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format, index 
files ('imgindx.tab' and 'srcindx.tab') that tabulate the 
contents of the CD, and documentation files.  For more 
information on the contents and organization of the CD volume set 
refer to the "FILES, DIRECTORIES AND DISK CONTENTS" section of 
this document.

The Clementine HiRes Mosaic was compiled for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by Malin Space 
Science Systems personnel under the direction of Dr. Michael C. 
Malin, principal Investigator.  Jeff Warren and Rick Adair 
comprised the technical group responsible for its compilation.  
Much of the background text in this document draws heavily on 
McEwen et al. [1997].

CLEMENTINE MISSION
===================
The Clementine Mission [Nozette et al., 1994] was a technology 
demonstration jointly sponsored by the Ballistic Missile Defense 
Organization (BMDO) and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA).  Clementine was launched on 1994-01-25 
aboard a Titan IIG rocket from Vandenburg Air Force Base.  The 
mission included two months of systematic lunar mapping (1994-02-
26 through 1994-04-21), which was to have been followed by a 
flyby of the near-Earth asteroid Geographos (1994-08-31).  
However, an onboard software error combined with improbable 
hardware conditions on 1994-05-07 led to accidental spin-up of 
the spacecraft and loss of attitude control gas.  This precluded 
the flyby of Geographos.


Clementine's primary objective was the qualification of light 
weight imaging sensors and component technologies for the next 
generation of Department of Defense spacecraft.  A second 
objective was the return of data about the Moon and Geographos to 
the international civilian scientific community.  For more 
information on the Clementine Mission refer to the 'mission.cat' 
file located in the 'catalog' directory.

The HiRes mosaic was created using the Clementine EDR Image 
Archive [Eliason, et al., 1995] produced by the Clementine 
mission.  The EDR (Engineering Data Record) data are raw images.  
The archive also includes tabulations of the unprocessed and 
uncorrected data properties.  The Clementine EDR Image Archive 
contains more than 1.9 million images acquired during active 
mission operations.  For information on how to obtain this 
archive contact the PDS Imaging Node or visit their world wide 
web site at the URL:  http://pdsimage.jpl.nasa.gov/PDS.

HIGH RESOLUTION (HiRes) IMAGING CAMERA
======================================
The HiRes camera combined a lightweight beryllium telescope with 
an image intensifier-coupled frame transfer CCD imager.  Image 
shuttering was accomplished through voltage gating of the image 
intensifier.  Maximum integration time was 733 milliseconds in 
10.67 microsecond increments.  The spectral response was limited 
in the system by the S-2 photocathode between 0.4 and 0.8 
microns.  Five spectral bands were available using a filter wheel 
that was controlled through the serial-addressable synchronous 
interface (SASI).  A sixth filter position was allocated to an 
opaque filter for the imager intensifier's protection.  
Additional information on the HiRes camera is in the 
'hresinst.cat' file in the 'catalog' directory. 

The post-FPA electronic circuitry was identical to that used in 
the UV/Vis camera: three gains states were allowed, followed by 5 
bits of offset that span 248 counts in the analog regime to 
augment the basic 8-bit A/D conversion.  Images of the Moon's day 
side used relatively low gain settings and intensifier gate times 
on the order of 1 ms.  Lifetime concerns about the photocathode 
and microchannel plates in the intensifier unit drove operations 
settings to low exposures.  This resulted in photon shot noise 
contributing significantly to the overall noise in the HiRes 
sensor.  Further, the image intensifier imposed a non-uniform, 
but predictable, artifact within the images.

LUNAR ORBIT SUMMARY
===================
The Clementine spacecraft maintained a polar orbit during the 
systematic mapping of the surface of the Moon.  Mapping of 
virtually 100% of the lunar surface was accomplished in two lunar 
days (two Earth months).  In order to obtain full coverage during 
these two months, the required image overlap for the UV/Vis and 
NIR cameras was ~15% in the down-track and ~10% in the cross-
track directions.  This required an orbit inclination of 90 
degrees plus-or- minus 1 degree with reference to the lunar 
equator, and that the periselene of the orbit be maintained at an 
altitude of 425 plus-or-minus 25 km.  To provide the necessary 
cross-track separation for the alternating imaging strips to 
cover the entire surface of the moon, the orbital period was 
approximately 5 hours, during which the moon rotated 
approximately 2.7 degrees beneath the spacecraft.  Images were 
generally taken and recorded only in the region of periselene, 
leaving sufficient time to replay the data to Earth.

The best data for lunar mineral mapping is obtained if the solar 
phase angle is less than 30 degrees.  The solar phase angle is 
defined as the angle between the vector to the Sun and the vector 
to the spacecraft from a point on the Moon's surface.  To 
maximize the time period in which the solar phase angle is less 
than 30 degrees, the plane of the orbit should contain the Moon-
Sun line half way through the two-month lunar mapping period.  
Therefore, insertion into orbit was selected so that, as the 
Moon-Sun line changed with Earth's motion about the Sun, the 
Moon-Sun line was initially close on the orbital plane, and then 
in the orbital plane half-way through the mapping mission.  The 
angle between the Moon-Sun line and the orbital plane was close 
(less than 5 degrees) for approximately five weeks before 
becoming zero.  The table shown below contains a list of 
Clementine's orbital parameters.  For more information on the 
Lunar orbit refer to the 'mission.cat' file located in the 
'catalog' directory.

GEOMETRIC ACCURACY
==================
The geometric placement of the HiRes mosaics is based primarily 
on registration with the Clementine Basemap Mosaic, which has 
accuracies approaching the UV/Vis scale.  Thus, an overview of 
Basemap Mosaic is appropriate.

The UV/Vis Basemap Mosaic
-------------------------
The goal of the  UV/Vis basemap was for 95% of the Moon 
(excluding the oblique observation gap fills) to have better than 
0.5 km/pixel absolute positional accuracy and to adjust the 
camera angles so that all frames match neighboring frames to 
within an accuracy of 2 pixels.

Approximately 265,000 match points were collected at the USGS 
from ~43,000 UV/Vis images, providing global coverage.  About 80% 
of these points were collected via autonomous procedures, whereas 
20% required the more time consuming but highly accurate manual 
pattern-recognition.  Oblique gap-fill images were the most 
difficult to match, and required substantial human intervention.  
Matching the polar regions was time-consuming because each frame 
overlapped many other frames.  Most match points were found to a 
precision of 0.2 pixels.

The USGS match points were sent to RAND Corporation for 
analytical triangulations.  Using these match points, control 
points from the Apollo region, and the latest NAIF/SPICE 
information, RAND determined improved camera orientation angles 
for the global set of UV/Vis images.  A spherical Moon of 
constant radius (1737.4 kilometers) was assumed, which was a 
significant source of error near the oblique gap fills.  The 
analytical triangulation is a least-squares formulation designed 
to adjust the latitude and longitude of the control points and 
the camera orientation angles to best fit the match points.  The 
final (global) analytical triangulation required solving ~660,000 
normal equations.  The mean error is less than 1 pixel.  This is 
by far the largest analytical triangulation ever applied to a 
planetary body other than Earth.  The results fully define the 
planimetric geometry of the basemap, to which future systematic 
products, including the HiRes mosaic, should be tied.

The HiRes Mosaic
----------------

Accurate placement of the map-projected HiRes images was 
accomplished by combining registration to the UV/Vis basemap at 
the basemap's resolution (100 m/pixel for sub-polar mosaics and 
150 m/pixel for polar mosaics ) with registration of overlapping 
HiRes pairs at five times this resolution (20 m/pixel sub-polar 
and 30 m/pixel polar).  The registrations were facilitated with 
automated image correlation.  These registrations were combined 
in a Least Absolute Deviation fit (Barrodale and Roberts, 1980) 
constrained to stray no further than some small amount from the 
basemap-scale registration.  Use of the least absolute deviation 
gives outliers less importance than does a least squares fit.  
Further manual placement of 1-5 percent of the images was 
required; these were due either to poor initial placement, 
particularly when the scene was featureless and provided few or 
no overlapping features with the UV/Vis basemap, or to mismatches 
of scene, resolution or illumination across seams in the UV/Vis 
mosaic.  Some misregistration of adjacent HiRes images remains in 
the final mosaic because the paramount goal was registration with 
the underlying UV/Vis Basemap Mosaic. The HiRes polar mosaics 
within approximately 2 degrees of the pole were dominantly 
registered to HiRes images rather than the basemap due to lack of 
useful basemap detail in that region.



RADIOMETRIC UNITS
=================
To date, absolute photometric calibration of the HiRes image data 
remains elusive.  This seems particularly problematic for the 
bulk of HiRes images, which were noisy due to the low gain 
setting intended to extend the life of the imaging system.  For 
this product, piece-wise intensity matching of the HiRes mosaics 
to the UV/Vis Basemap Mosaic was adopted as an approximate 
radiometric calibration.  The further decision was made to use 
750 nm ("D") filter HiRes images in order to best match the 
UV/Vis Basemap Mosaic, which dominantly comprises 750 nm ("B") 
filter images.  A more detailed description of the UV/Vis basemap 
photometric calibration may be found on the UV/Vis basemap 
volumes CL_30XX.

HiRes sub-polar mosaic tiles were individually calibrated against 
the underlying UV/Vis basemap. In constrast, each of the four 
HiRes polar mosaics employ a single calibration for all tiles due 
to the generally unreliable calibration of the underlying basemap 
in shadowed regions. These calibrations are each based on those 
of well-illuminated tiles and basemap.

In each tile header, the OFFSET and SCALING_FACTOR entries define 
HiRes fractional reflectances as follows:

   HIRES MOSAIC FRACTIONAL_REFLECTANCE = (SCALING_FACTOR * DN) + 
     OFFSET
   where: DN = 8-bit pixel value of HiRes mosaic image array.
          SCALING_FACTOR units are fractional reflectance per DN
            OFFSET units are fractional reflectance 


The calibration in every case included correction for the non-
uniformity of the raw HiRes images due to the light intensifier 
(Robinson, personal communication, 1997).

DATA PROCESSING
===============
Image processing tools developed at Malin Space Science Systems 
were used for image map projection, registration, tone matching 
and mosaicking.  MapMaker was used to generate context images 
from the UV/Vis Basemap Mosaic.

Generally, processing proceeded on an orbit and latitude "bin" 
basis, reflecting the organization of the Clementine EDR CDs.  A 
latitude bin consists of all images of a given orbit deemed to 
fall within a 10 degree latitude range based on SPICE 
information.  The latitude ranges are defined to fall on 10-
degree boundaries from -90 to +90.  For the sub-polar mosaics, 
sinusoidal map projection of images from a given orbit used the 
same central longitude, taken to be the orbit's longitude at the 
lunar equator. Polar mosaics employed the stereographic 
projection.

The HiRes mosaic was processed in 5 steps:

1. image calibration, map project, and basemap generation

2. lores registration

3. HiRes registration

4. constrained registration

5. mosaic and estimate photometric calibration


Step 1
-------
Following calibration for image non-uniformity, each image is 
warped with the equal-area sinusoidal or stereographic projection 
[Snyder, 1982], using the SPICE information in the EDR's PDS 
header.  Only "D" filter (750 nm) images are considered.  Images 
with no apparent content, indicated by MINIMUM = MAXIMUM (DN) 
header entries, or low intensifier gains (< 10) are rejected. 
Also rejected are images with excessive emission angles.

The HiRes SPICE information is erroneous to some degree, 
necessitating further effort to register them with the UV/Vis 
Basemap Mosaic.  Both high resolution (20 m/pixel or 30 m/pixel) 
and low-resolution (100 m/pixel or 150 m/pixel) versions are 
generated.  In the case of the sub-polar mosaic, this 
necessitated reprojection of the UV/Vis context to match the 
central longitude of a given orbit's images.

Step 2
------
Step 2 registers the HiRes images at UV/Vis basemap resolution.  
The HiRes images generally have some small systematic deviation 
away from a geometrically controlled position.  This deviation is 
of order 10-200 pixels at 100 m/pixel, tending to be largest near 
the poles.  Correlation of the HiRes images to the UV/Vis basemap 
permits estimation of HiRes image offsets relative to the UV/Vis 
basemap.  Provisional image placements that failed the 
correlation effort are estimated from neighboring "good" images 
that did not fail.  Very rarely, "holes" in the underlying 
basemap, due to absence of valid UV/Vis data, result in stretches 
of HiRes data which lack geometric constraint to the basemap.

Step 3
------
Overlapping "good" images are correlated against each other to 
provide a "full-resolution" placement constraint.

Step 4
------
The results of the reduced and full resolution registrations are 
combined to define a constrained, least absolute-deviation 
problem for the image placement.  Like the more familiar least-
squares fit procedure, this seeks to minimize deviation away from 
specified targets, in this case the nominal absolute and relative 
HiRes image placements.  However, least-squares tends to weight 
outlying locations in a manner considered undesirable.

An additional constraint is imposed by not allowing the any 
placement solution to stray further than 3 UV/Vis-resolution 
pixels from the nominal location.  Occasionally, this constraint 
must be relaxed to accommodate relatively severe UV/Vis mosaic 
seam offsets.

Step 5
------
Using the estimated placements, the full resolution HiRes images 
are provisionally mosaicked, laying frames down from south to 
north.  This provisional mosaic is manually examined to detect 
misplaced and invalid (no significant content) images, due in 
some cases to an image taken while gain states were transitioning 
to different values.  Misplaced images are manually mosaicked, 
and invalid images flagged for exclusion. In regions of great 
overlap, ie near the pole, redundant, poorer-quality data frames 
were excluded.

Because the UV/Vis Basemap Mosaic is the de facto control network 
for lunar cartography, HiRes images are permitted to mismatch 
each other when forced by UV/Vis scene content which is 
mismatched across mosaic seams.

Following the manual quality review, a final mosaic is produced 
as tiles that span approximately 1.75 degrees of latitude for the 
sub-polar mosaic, and 2250 pixel squares (approximately 2.2 deg) 
for the polar mosaics.  Low resolution versions with UV/Vis 
context are also generated to estimate an approximate photometric 
calibration.  The sub-polar calibrations are computed as the 
least-squares linear fit of the 1.75-degree tile's DN values to 
those of the underlying UV/Vis basemap, an 8-bit version 
generated from the 16-bit versions provided on CD.  This chain of 
linear scalings is then combined to provide a nominal scaling of 
the tile DNs to physical photometric (fractional reflectance) 
values. A single calibration is adopted for each of the four 
polar mosaics to mitigate problems associated with unreliable 
basemap calibrations due to shadows near the poles.  The 
calibrations of the polar mosaics are based on well-illuminated 
tiles and basemap portions.

IMAGE FILE ORGANIZATION
=======================
The image files are stored in a PDS compliant format.  An image 
file contains an label area (header) at the beginning of the file 
followed by the image data.  The number of bytes of the label 
area is a multiple of the number of bytes that make up an image 
line (number of samples * 1 bytes/pixel).  The image label area 
contains ASCII text data that contains information about the 
image file (see Image Labels section below).  The label area can 
be viewed with a simple ASCII editor on most computer systems.

Pixel Representation
--------------------
The Clementine HiRes mosaic is stored as image files with 8-bit 
unsigned integer pixels.

Image Labels
------------
The label area of a image file contains descriptive information 
about the image.  The label consists of keyword statements that 
conform to version 3 of the Object Description Language (ODL) 
developed by NASA's PDS project.  There are three types of ODL 
statements within a label: structural statements, keyword 
assignment statements, and pointer statements.

Structural statements provide a shell around keyword assignment 
statements to delineate which data object the assignment 
statements are describing.  The structural statements are:

         1) OBJECT = object_name
         2) END_OBJECT
         3) END

The OBJECT statement begins the description of a particular data 
object and the END_OBJECT statement signals the end of the 
object's description.  All keyword assignment statements between 
an OBJECT and its corresponding END_OBJECT statement describe the 
particular object named in the OBJECT statement.  The END 
statement terminates a label.  A keyword assignment statement 
contains the name of an attribute and the value of that 
attribute.  Keyword assignment statements are described in more 
detail in Appendix B of this document.  These statements have the 
following format:

         name = value

Values of keyword assignment statements can be numeric values, 
literals, and text strings.

Pointer statements are a special class of keyword assignment 
statements.  These pointers are expressed in the ODL using the 
following notation:

         ^object_name = location

If the object is in the same file as the label, the location of 
the object is given as an integer representing the starting 
record number of the object, measured from the beginning of the 
file.  The first label record in a file is record 1.  Pointers 
are useful for describing the location of individual components 
of a data object.  Pointer statements are also used for pointing 
to data or label information stored in separate files.  An 
example of a detached label (i.e., label information stored in a 
separate file) is shown below: By convention, detached labels are 
found in the LABEL directory.  

         ^STRUCTURE = 'logical_file_name'

The value of 'logical_file_name' is the name of the detached 
label file containing the description.

The keyword statements in the label are packed into the fixed-
length records that make up the keyword label area.  Each keyword 
statement is terminated by a carriage-return and line-feed 
character sequence.  An example of a Clementine HiRes strip 
mosaic image label is shown below.  Descriptions of the keywords 
used in the mosaic label are found in Appendix A.

INDEX FILES
===========
Each CD volume in the Clementine HiRes mosaic contains an image 
index file ('imgindx.tab') with catalog information about the 
entire basemap.  The image index file and it's associated PDS 
label file ('imgindx.lbl') are located in the 'index' directory.  
The catalog information in the index table includes the file 
names, CD volumes, and mapping parameter information.  An 
additional source file index table ('srcindx.tab' and 
corresponding PDS label 'srcindx.lbl')contains information about 
the EDR image collection used to assemble the basemap.  This file 
contains an entry for each EDR image that was used in the mosaic.  
For more information on the contents of the index files refer to 
the label files.
